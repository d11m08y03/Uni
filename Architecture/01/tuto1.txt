Question 1
  It is software stored on a memory chip on the motherboard. It is the first 
  software that runs when the computer powers on. It allows the user to do
  things like: change the boot order, change the date and time, change
  RAM settings, modify system volatages and many more.

  --> Manages essential devices before the OS is loaded.

Question 2
  When the PC is powered on, there will usually be a screen that displays
  the manufacturers logo for a short amount of time before booting. To
  access the BIOS, a key must be hit while the manufacturer's logo is
  visible. The key will either be DELETE or F2 but it will depend on the
  motherboard.

Question 3
  POST is a system diagnostic process that is carried out by the BIOS
  right after the computer is powered on. Its main function is to test
  whether all the components connected to the computer work properly.
  If there are issues detected, it will notify the user via beep sounds,
  LED lights or HEX codes.

Question 4
  BIOS beep codes help with trouble shooting. The motherboard manual
  will have a catalogue for translating beep sounds into actual error
  messages which may help solving an issue. For instance, a Beep Code 
  2 usually indicates that RAM was not detected.

Question 5
  Overclocking refers to increasing a CPU's clock speeds beyond the 
  manufacturer's specifications to gain more performance at the cost
  of higher thermals and lower CPU longetivity. Most people do not need
  overclocked hardware so, no. Usually people like gamers who need every
  bit of performance their systems can offer.
